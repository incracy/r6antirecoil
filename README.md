## Description

This program is a Lua script installer designed to work with Logitech GHub for the game Rainbow Six Siege. It allows users to easily switch between different versions of Anti-Recoil scripts for Logitech gaming devices based on their preferences.

These scripts were released publicly inside of a Discord server, where you can install a zip but that contains just the Lua file. The correct way to mass-install scripts in GHub is using programs like mine. With this installer, users can conveniently select and install specific versions of the Lua scripts they want to use in Logitech GHub.

## Features

- Easy installation of new or old versions of anti-recoil Lua scripts for Rainbow Six Siege.
- Able to perform a clean install for scripts
- And of course, anti-recoil in Rainbow Six Siege.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/incracy/r6antirecoil/releases/tag/r6) section.
2. Run the installer executable and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once it's done, you can press Enter to exit the installer, relaunch GHub and the scripts will be there (if you already have a profile set for anti-recoil)
